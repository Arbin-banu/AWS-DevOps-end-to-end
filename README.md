# AWS-DevOps-end-to-end
End-to-end project deployment of an application using CodeCommit, CodeArtifact, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline.

Steps:

1. Create a IAM user with "CodecommitPowerUser"  and "IAMUserChangePassword" permission
2. Create a user and download the .csv file
3. Open your created user and go to security tab and scrool down and generate HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit and save the file.
4. Create a new instance 
5. Open terminal
6. $sudo su
7. $apt-get update
8. $git clone<url from CodeCommit repo>
9. Go inside that directory
10. Enter your username and password from the .csv file which u downloaded (codecommit_credentials)
11. enter git commands:
  git status
  git add .
  git commit -m "first commit"
  git push origin master
  12. go to CodeCommit and check the file pushed
  13. Create a branch using "git checkout -b dev"
  14. create a new file and push the file in dev branch
  15. check CodeCommit and then click on Create pull request
  16. Complete the pull request and merge the branches.
  This Completes the CodeCommit Part
  
  1. Click on CodeBuild-> Create a build project
  2. Select the repo under sources
  3. For BuildSpec file, create a file in EC2 terminal. Find the file code below:
  
 vi buildspec.yml
  version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Installing NGINX
      - sudo apt-get update
      - sudo apt-get install nginx -y

  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build Started on $(date)
      - cp index.html /var/www/html/

  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Configuration NGINX

artifacts:
  files:
    - /var/www/html/index.html

  
  git branch --> to know the working branch
  git checkout master--> to change the branch
  Note: If you get git error, type this commands,
   1.  git pull origin master
   2.  git config --global pull.rebase true
   3.  git pull origin master
   4.  git push origin master
  
  4. Create CodeBuild
  5. Click on Start Build
  6. After your project is built successful , then go to build projects
  7. select the project--> edit--> artifact

Follow these steps and go further.
  
  
  Here completes your CodeBuild part.
  
  Now go further for CodeDeploy part.
  
  1. Click on CodeDeploy
  2. Create a new application
  3. And select cloud platform as EC2
  4. next create a deployment group
  5. Create an IAM role with below mentioned permissions:
  
 AmazonS3FullAccess	
AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeployLimited	
AWSCodeDeployRole
AWSCodeDeployFullAccess	
AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy	
AmazonEC2FullAccess
  
  after creating the role, go to trust relationship tab and edit the policy and add this new policy :
  
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "codedeploy.amazonaws.com",
          "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
  
  and save the role
  
6. Copy the ARN of the iam role and paste it under service role in deployment group
  
7. Select amazon EC2 instance under environment configuration
8. launch an ec2 instance , and then come back to deployment group and add that ec2 instance name
  
 9. Uncheck the load balancer checkbox.
  
  Finally deployment group is succesfully created.
  
  Now you can go further.
  
  
Now connect to your old instance and ls
  buildspec.yml index.html sample.txt
  
  1. Create a new file vi appspec.yml
  version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /
    destination: /var/www/html
hooks:
  AfterInstall:
    - location: script/install_nginx.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: script/start_nginx.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  
 2. Create a directory mkdir scripts
  
  vi install_nginx.sh
  
  #!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nginx
  
  
  vi start_nginx.sh
  
  #!/bin/bash

sudo service nginx start
  
  Save both the files and come back with cd ..
  
  git status 
 3. and push all the files to CodeCommit
  
Now build your project again
  1. Go to CodeDeploy -> Create a deployment
  2. give the path of s3 zip file, and select zip
  3. create deployment
  4. Deployment will be in pending state
  
  Create a new role ec2deployment with permissions:
  AmazonEC2FullAccess
  CodeDeployFullAccess
 S3FullAccess

  1. Now go back to your instance cat install.sh
  $sudo service codedeploy-agent restart
